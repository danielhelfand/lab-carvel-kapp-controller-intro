In this tutorial, you will learn about how kapp-controller brings package management
and continuous delivery concepts to Kubernetes. 

You will learn about the custom resource definitions (CRDs) introuduced 
to the Kubernetes API via kapp-controller, deploy applications to a Kubernetes cluster 
through kapp-controller's CRDs, and learn about the underlying tools of the Carvel suite (i.e., 
ytt, kapp, kbld, imgpkg, and vendir) that allow for simple authoring of an application's manifests 
and consumption (i.e. deployment) of these applications to Kubernetes by end users.
