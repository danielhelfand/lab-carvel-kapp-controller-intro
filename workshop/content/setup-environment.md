Before getting started, take a moment to learn about the tutorial environment you are working in.

All commands in this tutorial can be executed by clicking the running stick figure icon on the side 
of the command. Go ahead and run the following command to see the version of kubectl/Kubernetes available 
during this workshop:

```execute-1
kubectl version
```

The number next to the running stick figure icon indicates where a command will be run (i.e. 1 for the top 
terminal and 2 for the bottom). Go ahead and run the command below and see how it runs in the lower terminal:

```execute-2
echo hello from second terminal
```

Go ahead and clear both terminals and then follow the instructions in the text on the left side of the screen 
throughout the rest of the tutorial:

```execute-1
clear
```

```execute-2
clear
```
